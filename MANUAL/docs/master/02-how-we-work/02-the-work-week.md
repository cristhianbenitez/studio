# The Work Week

Sanctuary ebbs and flows with the tides of a weekly sprint. Here's how it works.

## Starting Times

At Sanctuary, you'll start between 9 and 11am, and finish 8 hours later (5 to 7pm). That window is designed to work for early risers and late sleepers alike, while giving everyone a 30 minute window to catch up on communication and life admin before our standup at 11:30am.

[note]
Just get here before 11am, and you're not late. Coming in after 11am should be a rare occurance.

## Sprint Planning on Mondays

On Mondays, we'll plan our sprint for the week, and update our clients of our progress.

We use [Zenhub](https://www.zenhub.com/) to move `13.5` story points into the `To Do` column of our board, and sum up last week's progress for the client. We'll use the opportunity to ask the client any outstanding questions, too.

[note]
We don't do standup on Monday, because Sprint Planning covers those bases.

## Standups at 11:30am

Every day sans monday, we'll do Standup at 11:30am. We'll go clockwise around the circle and talk about what we did yesterday, and what we're planning to do today. It's a chance to ask for updates on any blockers, and lets everyone know what's being worked on!

## Retrospective on Fridays at 3pm

Around 3pm on Friday we'll do a retrospective. That's when we discuss our projects from a high level, and identify concerns that we need to solve for in the coming week. It's a chance to rest and reflect so we can go into the weekend relaxed.

## 80/20 Time after Retrospective

After Retrospective, we like to work on some learning or side project hacking work. It's a chance to fit a bit of that passion project into the work week, and generally progress as a creative outside of the project you're on.

## Premium Fridays

In the spirit of [Yvon Chouinard's "Let My People Go Surfing"](https://www.patagonia.com/product/let-my-people-go-surfing-revised-paperback-book/BK067.html), we take the last Friday of every month off, for a paid day off - or as we like to say, we take an extra 12 long weekends every year. The extra time off makes for a happy and refreshed team, and we find it's more than worth the investment.
